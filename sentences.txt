The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.   
Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.   
She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.   
The door slammed on the watermelon.   
It's a skateboarding penguin with a sunhat!   
He excelled at firing people nicely.   
He always wore his sunglasses at night.   
Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.   
He decided to live his life by the big beats manifesto.   
People keep telling me 'orange' but I still prefer 'pink'.
